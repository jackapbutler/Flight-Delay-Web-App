# Flight_Delay_Web_App
Machine learning app using web-scraped data http://jackapbutler123.pythonanywhere.com/

1. The data was collected using python (mainly pandas) webscraping tools. 

2. The resulting dataframe was cleaned using pandas and numpy in the Departure_Web_Scraping jupyter notebook. 

3. This cleaned data was then exported to a csv file.

4. Tasks 1, 2 & 3 were automated through task scheduler and python scripts.

5. Exploratory data analysis was performed on the clean dataframe within Excel in the Flight Delay Analysis workbook.

6. Multiple machine learning models were trained on different response variables before the most efficient & accurate solution was chosen.

7. This model was then deployed as a web application through Flask and pythonanywhere using HTML and CSS to create the webpages.
